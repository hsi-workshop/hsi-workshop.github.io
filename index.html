					<p>As an effective method for solving complex optimization problems, heuristic search has been widely used in industry, including logistics, digital maps, cloud computing, as well as manufacturing, among others. Work on heuristic search has a long tradition in AI, and there has been much progress over the last few decades. Advanced techniques in heuristic search are highly relevant for a range of real-world applications. On the other hand, real-world industrial applications give rise to interesting data sets and problems in this areas, and can also reveal bottlenecks and limitations of existing methods. The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts on heuristic search from academia and industry, and to promote real-world applications of heuristic search. </p>
					<!-- <p><font color="#FF0000">News update:</font> According to the updating news of <a href="https://ijcai-22.org/">IJCAI-ECAI 2022</a> website, as with IJCAI-ECAI 2022 conference, we are making backup plans for either a delayed workshop or a virtual (online) workshop.</p>
					<p><font color="#FF0000">News update:</font> IJCAI-PRICAI has been postponed. The most likely scenario for this event would be in Kyoto from January 5-10, 2021. We would aim to provide options for remote participation, e.g., allowing authors to present remotely and more opportunities for remote attendees. </p>
					<p><font color="#FF0000">News update:</font> This HSI workshop will be held via online meeting on January 7, 2021.  (12am-5am UTC 8am-1pm UTC) </p> -->

					<div  class="des txt-justify">Fred Glover holds the title of Distinguished University Professor, Emeritus, in the School of Engineering, the Department of Applied Mathematics and in the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado. He is also Chief Technology Officer of OptTek Systems, Inc., in charge of algorithmic design and strategic planning initiatives. He has authored or co-authored more than 500 published articles and eight books in the fields of mathematical optimization, computer science and artificial intelligence, and is the originator of  “Tabu Search,” an adaptive memory programming algorithm for mathematical optimization in complex search spaces, for which Google returns more than 1,000,000 results. He is an elected member of the U. S. National Academy of Engineering and is the recipient of the von Neumann Theory Prize, the highest honor of the INFORMS Society, as well as numerous other awards and honorary fellowships.  He also serves on advisory boards for numerous journals and professional organizations and has co-founded several research and consulting companies in the areas of simulation optimization, logistics and analytics. </div>

						Daniel Harabor is a Senior Lecturer at Monash University, Australia, and is also a DECRA Research Fellow in the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia. He is interested in sequential decision-making problems of the type that appear in the areas of AI Planning and Heuristic Search. Often these problems involve one or more agents moving through a task environment. His job in this case is to find a collision-free trajectory that brings each agent from an initial start location and to a desired target position. Such problems appear in many settings including Robotics, GPS Navigation and in Computer Games. In his research he aims to develop fast algorithms that are useful in practice but which also come with guarantees. </div>
